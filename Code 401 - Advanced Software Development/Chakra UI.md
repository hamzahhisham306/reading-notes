# Reading Notes

1. What is a Chakra UI?
  >> Chakra UI is a simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks you need to build your React applications.

2. Is Chakra UI better than material UI?
 
>> The Material UI React library provides users with a handful of UI layout tools but is most famous for its large breadth of pre-styled UI components to which developers can apply custom styles to override out-of-the-box base styles. Chakra UI is a more robust, layout-focused library that also provides developers with UI components similar to those that Material UI provides, but has a greater focus on the creation of flexible, composable, and scalable code.

3. How to use Chakra UI?
 >> To use Chakra UI in your project, run one of the following commands in your terminal:


 >> npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion

 >> yarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
  
  
 >> After installing Chakra UI, you need to set up the ChakraProvider at the root of your application. This can be either in your index.jsx, index.tsx or App.jsx depending on the framework you use.
