# Reading Notes
1- Graph:
  >> is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph can be defined as, A Graph consisting of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and a set of edges that connect a pair of nodes.



2- types of Graphs:
  - Finite Graphs
  - Infinite Graph
  - Trivial Graph
  - Simple Graph
  - Multi Graph
  - Digraph Graph
  - Subgraph
  - Connected or Disconnected Graph
  - Labeled Graph
  - Bipartite Graph
  - Regular Graph
  - Complete Graph
  - Null Graph


3- Difference between graph and tree
   1- Graph:
     -Structure: It is a collection of vertices/nodes and edges.
     -Edges	:Each node can have any number of edges.	
     - Types of Edges	:They can be directed or undirected	
     - Root node	:A cycle can be formed.	
     - Traversal	:For graph traversal, we use Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS).	
   2- Tree:
     -Structure: It is a collection of nodes and edges.
     -Edges	:If there is n nodes then there would be n-1 number of edges	
     - Types of Edges	:They are always directed	
     - Root node	There is a unique node called root(parent) node in trees.
     - Traversal: We traverse a tree using in-order, pre-order, or post-order traversal methods.
