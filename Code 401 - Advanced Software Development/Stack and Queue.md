# Reading Notes


1. What's the difference between Stack and Queue?
  >> Stack is last in first out, to add and remove element just from one side (Top),  a stack is a limited access data structure, add  element is called push , remove element is called pop, Simple Implementation , There are no variants available for stack


  
  >> Queue (ٍStack opposite)is first in first out , to add element just from one side is (Back) , to remove element just from one side (front), add  element is called enqueue, remove element is called dequeue , Complex implementation in comparison to stack, There are three types of variants i.e circular queue, double-ended queue and priority queue





2. What is Stacks and how to use it? 
>> Stack is an array with specific properties,  push the item into the stack, and pop the item out of the stack. A stack is a limited access data structure - elements can be added and removed from the stack only at the top. push adds an item to the top of the stack, pop removes the item from the top

>> how to use it? Use a stack when you want to get things out in the reverse order than you put them in 
>> For example when making a project on VS Code and writing code then you want to back to the old state you have to click on CTRL+Z to access the first state code.

3. What is Queue?
>> A queue is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order.
We define a queue to be a list in which all additions to the list are made at one end, and all deletions from the list are made at the other end.  The element which is first pushed into the order, the operation is first performed on that.
