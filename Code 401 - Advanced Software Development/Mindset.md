# Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice.

> Work on a daily basis won't improve you. By improving your hard technical skills, all of your code will be better. It gives you new opportunities,
 broadens your knowledge horizons, and finally expands your computer-related possibilities.

>It is important to choose the challenges' objectives so that meeting them teaches you something new. The lessons you learnt along the journey are more important than the final outcome.


### The key ideas behind deliberate practice is that it:

1. Pushes you just outside your comfort zone
2. Repeated often
3. Feedback on results in continuously available
4. It's highly demanding mentally
5. It's difficult
6. It requires good goals


# Growth Mindset.
 > Someone with a growth mindset views intelligence, abilities, and talents as learnable and capable of improvement through effort. On the other hand, someone with a fixed mindset views those same traits as inherently stable and unchangeable over time.
 
 > For example, as an aspiring entrepreneur, you need basic finance skills to create your business’s budget and prepare its financial statements. If you have a fixed mindset, you may think, I have  never been good with math, let alone financial statements. I’m not cut out to run my own business.

 > When you have a growth mindset, you believe you can gain the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed, which makes every challenge a learning opportunity. Given the numerous challenges entrepreneurs face, a growth mindset can be a powerful tool as you work toward your venture’s success.
