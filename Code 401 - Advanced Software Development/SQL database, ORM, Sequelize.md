# Reading Notes 

1. What's the difference between SQL  and NoSQL?
  - **SQL** :primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS);	
  - not best fit for hierarchical data storage	
  - either open-source or close-sourced from commercial vendors	
  - uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful	
  - are vertically scalable	
  - **NoSQL** :
  - database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
  - fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.
  - queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.
  - are horizontally scalable
  - can be classified on the basis of way of storing data as graph databases, key-value store databases, document store databases, column store database and XML databases.

2. What is Sequlize and how to use it with Node js?
  > Sequelize is a Node. js-based Object Relational Mapper that makes it easy to work with MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL databases, and more. An Object Relational Mapper performs functions like handling database records by representing the data as objects.

3. What is an ORM, how does it work, and how should I use one?
 > Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm. When talking about ORM, most people are referring to a library that implements the Object-Relational Mapping technique, hence the phrase "an ORM"

 > An ORM library is a completely ordinary library written in your language of choice that encapsulates the code needed to manipulate the data, so you don't use SQL anymore; you interact directly with an object in the same language you're using.
 
 > It fits in your natural way of coding (itâ€™s your language!).
 
 > It abstracts the DB system, so you can change it whenever you want.
 > 
 > The model is weakly bound to the rest of the application, so you can change it or use it anywhere else.
 > 
 > It lets you use OOP goodness like data inheritance without a headache.
