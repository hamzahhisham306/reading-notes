# Reading Notes

1. The Hash table data structure stores elements in key-value pairs where
    - Key- unique integer that is used for indexing the values
    - Value - data that are associated with keys.
 
2. Hashing (Hash Function)
>> In a hash table, a new index is processed using the keys. And, the element corresponding to that key is stored in the index. This process is called hashing. Let k be a key and h(x) be a hash function.
Here, h(k) will give us a new index to store the element linked with k.


3. Hash Collision
>> When the hash function generates the same index for multiple keys, there will be a conflict (what value to be stored in that index). This is called a hash collision. We can resolve the hash collision using one of the following techniques.
  - Collision resolution by chaining
  - Open Addressing: Linear/Quadratic Probing and Double Hashing.
