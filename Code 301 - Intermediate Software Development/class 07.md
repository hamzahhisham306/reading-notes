# Reading Notes.

1. Who is Roy Fielding?
 > Roy Thomas Fielding is an American computer engineer and scientist, one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the creator of 
 > the representational state transfer architecture.
2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
 > Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in 
 the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements.
 You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.
3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
  > is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

  > using a url to obtain a resource. Using GET, each system would obtain information from the others.
