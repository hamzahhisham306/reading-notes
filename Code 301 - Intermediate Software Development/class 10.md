# Reading Notes

## we have to read about terms and built in function to understand it and how to use it.


1. What is a ‘call’?
   > The call stack is primarily used for function invocation
   
2. How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
   > once In Asynchronous
 
3. What does LIFO mean?
   >  last in first out (LIFO)

4. Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

   function firstFunction(){
  throw new Error('Stack Trace Error');
   }

  function secondFunction(){
  firstFunction();
  }

  function thirdFunction(){
  secondFunction();
  }

  thirdFunction();

5. What causes a Stack Overflow?
  > When a function calls itself repeatedly without an exit point, it causes a stack overflow.

6. What is a ‘reference error’?
  > an error when a variable that doesn't exist (or hasn't yet been initialized) in the current scope is referenced.
  
7. What is a ‘syntax error’?
  > are mistakes in the source code, such as spelling and punctuation errors, incorrect labels, and so on, which cause an error message to be generated by the compiler.
  
8. What is a ‘range error’?
  > thrown when trying to pass a value as an argument to a function that does not allow a range that includes the value
  
9. What is a ‘tyep error’?
  > As the name implies, these errors occur when the types like number string,  you are attempting to use or access are incompatible, such as when you are attempting to 
  > access a property in a variable that has an undefined type.
  
10. What is a breakpoint?
  >  a point in the program where the code will stop executing
  
11. What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?
  > is a software tool that can help the software development process by identifying coding errors at various stages of the operating system or 
  > application development
