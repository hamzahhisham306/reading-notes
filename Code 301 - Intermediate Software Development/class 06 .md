# Reading Notes
# we have to read about terms and built in function to understand it and how to use it.

1. What is node.js?
 > Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.
 
2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
 > is the free and open-source JavaScript engine used by Google Chrome and other web browsers built on the Chromium platform, such as Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. 
 > It is in charge of directly converting JavaScript into native machine code that your computer can run because it was built with performance in mind.
 
3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
 > This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers.
 
4. What is npm?
 > It is the most popular package management system for the JavaScript programming language, and is the default package manager for the Node.js JavaScript platform.
 
5. What version of node are you running on your machine?
 >  V16.13.1

6. What version of npm are you running on your machine?
 >  8.1.2

7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’? 
 > npm install -g jshint

8. What is node used for?
 > Node enables programmers to create JavaScript code that executes within the computer's operating system rather than a browser. Because Node has access to the operating system, 
 > file system, and everything else needed to create fully functional apps, it may be used to create server-side applications.

9. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
 > Greater efficiency
 > Engaged collaboration
 > Learning from fellow students
 > Social skills
 > Job interview readiness
 > Work environment readiness
 
10. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
 > Work environment readiness
 
11. How does pair programming work?
 > Pair programming typically involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator, however there are many distinct techniques. The only programmer with hands on the 
 > keyboard is the Driver, who is also typing. The Driver oversees the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course—writing code as part of the
 > mechanics of coding. The Navigator does not directly interact with the computer; instead, they utilize their words to direct the Driver. The Navigator searches
 > for errors or flaws while considering the larger picture, what will happen next, and how an algorithm might be turned to code. The Navigator shouldn't be creating any code, 
 > but they may use their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation.
